# TypeScript in React Demo: Enhance Your React Project

Welcome to the TypeScript in the React Demo repository! This repository showcases the integration of TypeScript into React applications, as demonstrated in the articles ["Add TypeScript to Your Existing React Project"](https://www.letsreact.org/add-typescript-to-your-existing-react-project/) and ["How to Create a React App with TypeScript"](https://www.letsreact.org/how-to-create-react-app-with-typescript/) on [Let's React](https://www.letsreact.org).
